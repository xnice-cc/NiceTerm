//! Marker-based output capture for AI Agent PTY command execution.
//!
//! Instead of opening a separate exec channel (which is unaware of nested
//! shells, containers, or SSH hops), we inject the command directly into the
//! interactive PTY wrapped with unique boundary markers, then intercept the
//! markers in the output stream to extract the command's output and exit code.
//!
//! Key design decisions:
//!
//! 1. The shell **echoes** everything written to the PTY. The command text
//!    itself appears in the output stream before the command runs. We handle
//!    this with a `WaitingForStart` phase that suppresses all output until
//!    the real START marker appears in the *execution* output.
//!
//! 2. The wrapper breaks or escapes marker patterns so the echo text never
//!    contains a matchable `__DF_CMD_START_` or `__DF_CMD_END_` sequence.
//!    Only the execution output does.
//!
//! 3. Variable names avoid `__` to prevent the end-marker parser from
//!    finding false `__` suffixes inside echoed variable references.
//!
//! 4. After the END marker, a `PostCapture` phase suppresses the shell
//!    prompt that would otherwise appear as a blank line (since the
//!    command itself was invisible).
