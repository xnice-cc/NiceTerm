# Tunnels, Proxy, and Jump Hosts

NyaTerm separates network-related features into three layers:

1. **Proxy** — how the app reaches the network
2. **Jump host** — which SSH host acts as the intermediate hop
3. **Tunnel** — where port traffic is mapped

These features often appear together in real environments, but they solve different problems.

## Proxy

A proxy helps NyaTerm establish outbound connectivity to the remote side.

Currently supported:

- **SOCKS5**
- **HTTP**
- **ProxyCommand**

Each proxy configuration can store:

- Name
- Protocol
- Host
- Port
- Username / password
- ProxyCommand command template

### ProxyCommand

ProxyCommand is useful when you already have a command-line proxy, gateway, or corporate network helper. NyaTerm replaces OpenSSH-style placeholders in the command template:

| Placeholder | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| `%h` | Target host |
| `%p` | Target port |
| `%r` | Login username |
| `%%` | Literal `%` |

Example:

```bash
nc -X connect -x jump.example.com:1080 %h %p
```

If your environment depends on a custom gateway, bastion command, or local proxy program, save it as a ProxyCommand profile and select it from the advanced section of an SSH connection.

Proxies are managed centrally in the Network panel, then selected from the advanced section of an SSH connection.

Typical use cases:

- Corporate networks that require outbound proxy access
- Regions where direct access is restricted
- Teams that want a reusable set of outbound network profiles

## Jump hosts

A jump host is SSH-specific. It does not replace a proxy. Instead, it uses another saved SSH connection as the intermediate entry point.

Typical use cases:

- Bastion hosts
- Internal hosts that are not directly reachable
- Multi-layer SSH network isolation

In the SSH connection advanced section, you can pick an existing saved SSH connection as the jump host. NyaTerm validates the jump-host chain:

- Missing referenced jump hosts are blocked or surfaced for correction
- Recursive relationships are rejected so connections cannot loop forever
- Multi-hop designs should stay as clear one-way chains, for example `local -> bastion -> internal host`

## Tunnels

NyaTerm provides a dedicated tunnel management area in the Network panel, so port mappings can be saved and reused instead of retyped as one-off commands.

### Tunnel types

- **Local tunnel**
- **Remote tunnel**
- **Dynamic tunnel (SOCKS5)**

### Local tunnel

A local tunnel binds a local listening port and forwards traffic to a remote target. It is useful for:

- Accessing internal databases
- Opening web consoles that are only reachable from the remote host
- Securely forwarding service ports through SSH

### Remote tunnel

A remote tunnel binds a port on the remote side and forwards it back to a local service. It is useful for:

- Temporarily exposing a local service to the remote environment
- Reverse debugging or temporary integration work

### Dynamic tunnel

A dynamic tunnel creates a local SOCKS5 proxy port. It is useful for:

- Pointing a browser or tool at an SSH-backed proxy temporarily
- Quickly building an outbound path through SSH

## Tunnel configuration

When creating a tunnel, you typically configure:

- Tunnel name
- Tunnel type
- Associated SSH connection
- Listen port
- Target host / target port for local and remote tunnels
- Whether to bind only to `127.0.0.1`
- Whether to auto-open the tunnel

If the port only needs to be used locally, keeping it bound to `127.0.0.1` is usually safer than listening on `0.0.0.0`.

## Daily operations in the Network panel

In the Network panel, you can:

- Create / edit / delete proxies
- Create / edit / delete tunnels
- Open or close a tunnel directly
- See whether a tunnel is currently active

This turns network setup into something reusable and visible instead of a collection of one-off shell commands.

## Common combinations

### Example 1: Proxy + SSH

- Save a SOCKS5 proxy in the Network panel
- Select that proxy in an SSH connection's advanced section
- Useful in corporate or cross-region network environments

### Example 2: Jump host + target host

- Save the bastion connection first
- Set that bastion as the jump host on the target host connection
- Useful for layered internal network access

### Example 3: SSH + local tunnel

- Create the SSH connection
- Save a local tunnel such as `localhost:15432 -> db.internal:5432`
- Then access the database locally via `127.0.0.1:15432`
