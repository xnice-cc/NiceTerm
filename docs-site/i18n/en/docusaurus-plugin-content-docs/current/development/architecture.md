# Architecture

NyaTerm is a **Tauri 2** desktop application. The frontend lives in `src/`, the backend lives in `src-tauri/src/`, and they communicate through Tauri commands and events.

## Overall architecture

## Frontend window model

The frontend entry path is selected in `src/main.tsx`:

- **Main window** — loads `AppProvider` and `App.tsx`
- **Child windows** — load `ChildAppProvider` and `ChildWindowRouter`

Current child-window flows include:

- Settings
- New session
- Quick command editing
- Auto-upload prompts

Relevant files:

- `src/main.tsx`
- `src/ChildWindowRouter.tsx`
- `src/lib/windowManager.ts`

`windowManager.ts` also coordinates focus and interactivity between modal child windows and the main window.

## Frontend state model

### AppContext

`src/context/AppContext.tsx` is the main state container for the primary window. It owns:

- Workspace tabs and pane trees
- Application settings and UI settings
- Saved connections and group refreshes
- Startup restoration for `ui.open_tabs`

### ChildAppProvider

`src/context/ChildAppProvider.tsx` is a lightweight provider used by child windows:

- Loads and saves settings only
- Syncs with the main window through events
- Does not manage the full workspace or active session state

### TransferContext

`src/context/TransferContext.tsx` manages the file transfer queue separately. It consumes backend `transfer-event` notifications and drives pause, resume, cancel, and retry behavior in the UI.

## Workspace model

NyaTerm's terminal workspace has two layers that are easy to confuse but serve different purposes.

### Logical tabs and pane trees

`src/lib/workspaceTabs.ts` is responsible for:

- Creating tabs and session panes
- Horizontal and vertical splits inside a tab
- Persisting `ui.open_tabs`
- Restoring the serializable workspace structure on startup

### Runtime window layout

`src/lib/tabWindows.ts` is responsible for:

- Which tabs are currently attached to which window leaf
- The active tab inside each leaf
- Runtime window split ratios

A practical shorthand is:

- `workspaceTabs.ts` = the logical workspace that gets persisted
- `tabWindows.ts` = the live runtime arrangement of terminal areas

## Terminal integration

`src/components/terminal/XTerminal.tsx` is the xterm.js integration center. It is responsible for:

- Fit / Search / WebLinks and related addons
- Shell integration and command-history suggestions
- Line-number / timestamp gutter
- Action links and keyword highlighting
- Large-output protection and recovery messaging
- Session event subscriptions and reconnect behavior

## Backend runtime model

`src-tauri/src/lib.rs` is the backend entry point. It constructs and stores shared runtime state such as:

- `SessionManager`
- `TunnelManager`
- `RecordingManager`
- `PendingAuthManager`
- `CloudSyncManager`

It also registers Tauri commands centrally, including commands for:

- Session creation / close / write / recording / OTP flows
- SFTP file and transfer operations
- Connections, keys, passwords, OTP, and settings persistence
- Cloud sync / backup status, push, pull, restore, and conflict handling
- Watcher, translation, importer, stats, tunnel, and proxy flows

## SessionManager and event flow

`src-tauri/src/core/session.rs` contains `SessionManager`, the central registry for active sessions. It is responsible for:

- Tracking all active sessions
- Routing commands into per-session I/O loops
- Maintaining command history and fuzzy search storage
- Emitting `sessions-changed`, `command-history-changed`, and related events

The backend also emits these common events to the frontend:

| Event | Description |
|------|------|
| `terminal-output-{id}` | Terminal output |
| `cwd-changed-{id}` | Working directory updates |
| `session-closed-{id}` | Session closed |
| `sessions-changed` | Session list changed |
| `connections-changed` | Saved connections changed |
| `transfer-event` | Transfer queue progress changed |
| `otp-request` | OTP / keyboard-interactive authentication requested |
| `cloud-sync-status-changed` | Cloud sync / backup status changed |
| `cloud-sync-history-changed` | Sync / backup history changed |
| `cloud-sync-conflict` | Cloud sync conflict preview and handling entry point |

## SSH, SFTP, watcher, and import flows

Core backend capabilities are mainly organized under these modules:

- `src-tauri/src/core/ssh/` — SSH connection setup, authentication, OSC/CWD tracking, SFTP, tunnels
- `src-tauri/src/core/pty.rs` — local terminal sessions
- `src-tauri/src/core/telnet.rs` — Telnet sessions
- `src-tauri/src/core/serial.rs` — serial sessions
- `src-tauri/src/core/watcher.rs` — local file watching and auto-upload workflows
- `src-tauri/src/core/importer.rs` — Xshell / MobaXterm / WindTerm session import
- `src-tauri/src/core/recording.rs` — session recording
- `src-tauri/src/core/cloud_sync.rs` — cloud sync, status events, and conflict handling
- `src-tauri/src/core/portable_snapshot.rs` — portable snapshot build/apply logic and sync scope control

## Configuration and persistence

Application data is stored in `~/.nyaterm/nyaterm.redb`. Primary redb documents include:

- JSON documents: `settings`, `sessions`, `keys`, `passwords`, `otp`, `quick-command`, `tunnels`, `proxies`, `history`, `cloud-sync-state`
- Text documents: `known_hosts`, `master.key`

When upgrading from Dragonfly, NyaTerm copies `~/.dragonfly/dragonfly.redb`; if the old environment only has `.dragonfly` JSON / text files, they are copied and imported into redb. The old directory is not deleted.

Sensitive values are encrypted before being written, so the app manages reusable credential records rather than plain-text secrets.

Cloud sync adds two more important layers:

- `src-tauri/src/config/cloud_sync.rs` manages provider settings, runtime state, and sensitive-field encrypt / mask / merge behavior
- `src-tauri/src/core/portable_snapshot.rs` defines which data belongs in portable snapshots and which device-local UI state stays local
